\section{Convex optimisation}

When applied to an MPC controller in \cite{Wang10}, a bespoke quadratic program (QP) solver achieved a 200Hz control frequency on a system with 13 states and 3 inputs over a 30-step control horizon.
This was achievable by taking advantage of the structure of the MPC problem and the QP that was formed.
The authors implemented an algorithm that solved the problem with time complexity linear in the horizon dimension, rather than cubic as seen in interior-point methods.

\section{Hot water system modelling}

Camacho and Bordons estimate that one of the key differences in MPC control is the significant up-front modelling effort, as the system model is very important to the overall control achieved.
Therefore we take care to study various efforts to model hot water tanks.
