\subsection{Applications}

When applied to an MPC controller in \cite{Wang10}, a bespoke quadratic program
(QP) solver achieved a 200Hz control frequency on a system with 13 states and 3
inputs over a 30-step control horizon. This was achievable by taking advantage
of the structure of the MPC problem and the QP that was formed. The authors
implemented an algorithm that solved the problem with time complexity linear in
the horizon dimension, rather than cubic as seen in interior-point methods
\cite{}.
