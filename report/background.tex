\subsection{Need and uses}

As we enter the twenty-first century, sustainability, energy security, and new ways to meet our increasing energy demands are on the agendas of many governments.
The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill of 2012 \cite{} aims to provide the legal framework to promote and regulate the development of products that reduce energy use and/or greenhouse gas emissions in Australia.

In Australia, water heating is the second-largest residential energy end use, accounting for an estimated 23\% of energy consumption \cite{REMP12}.
This is second only to HVAC (air conditioning and space heating).
In some nations, the number may be as high as 30\% to 50\% \cite{Lane96}.
