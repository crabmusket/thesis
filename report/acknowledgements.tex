\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I must thank my parents deeply, Ruth and Derek, for giving me the opportunity to be here, writing this note of acknowledgment.
Without their love and support I would be lost.
Secondly, I would like to give heartfelt thanks to Ian, my supervisor.
I have learned a lot from him, and remain grateful for the opportunity to work on this topic.
To my closest friends, Tian and Nick: thanks for the encouragement, companionship, and commiseration!

And above all, \emph{soli Deo gloria.}
