\chapter{System Description}
\label{ch:system}

\todo{Write this chapter}

Describe here the system that will be considered for simulation.

\section{Location}

Describe physical environment/location/other relevant factors exterior to the system itself, including probable load conditions, ambient temperature, etc.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Location of the system -- therefore likely weather patterns.
	\item Load conditions (i.e. how many people in the house, what other equipment).
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware}

Describe the physical elements of the system.

Diagram.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hot tank
	\item Aux heater
	\item Collector
	\item Three-way collector valve
	\item Emergency release
	\item Plumbing
\end{itemize}

\section{Water zones}

Describe the size and any other relevant information of the water masses in the system.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The tank itself. How big?
	\item The water flowing through the collector. How much?
	\item The water flowing through the auxiliary heater. How much?
\end{itemize}

\section{Internal controllers}

Describe the internal controllers of the system and their operation.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Auxiliary pump controller
	\item Auxiliary heat controller
	\item Collector pump controller
\end{itemize}
