\todo{Write this chapter}

Outline the experiments performed to compare the performance of the different controllers.

\section{Weather and load schedules}

How did I come up with ambient temperature, insolation, and load?

\begin{itemize}
	\item CER data
	\item Modified load data for empty days and increased overall load
\end{itemize}

\section{Prediction accuracy}

How did I come up with predictions that were reasonable yet reasonably inaccurate?

\section{Metrics}

How did I measure the performance of each controller?

\begin{itemize}
	\item RMS error in user's desired temperature?
	\item Amount of time where temperature requirement unsatisfied?
	\item Total energy use
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment matrix}

Grid of variables that were used for each experiment.
Be sure to cover properties like handling an inaccurate prediction, and the effect of the PWM period.
