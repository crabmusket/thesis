\chapter{Statement of contribution}

My personal contribution to this thesis is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Conducting the literature review using sources recommended by my supervisor or discovered independently.
	\item Reproducing the mathematical model of a hot water tank found in \textcite{Cristofari02}.
	\item Extending this model with an auxiliary heater and a simplified solar collector with guidance from people currently working in the solar industry.
	\item Producing Python code to implement these mathematical systems within the SciPy simulation framework.
	\item Producing Python code using the CVXOPT and CVXPY libraries to perform model-predictive control on the system.
	\item Running simulations of the system and controller, and analysing the results in light of the reading I had performed and discussions with industry members.
	\item Producing all graphics and graphs in this paper, except where noted, with the aid of the matplotlib library, gnuplot software, and Google Sheets software.
\end{itemize}
