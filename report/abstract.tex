Water heating accounts for significant portion of domestic energy usage.
With the aim of reducing this amount, weather and user behaviour forecasts can be used in a model-predictive control strategy for the auxiliary heating element.
A nonlinear model of a stratified hot water tank was reproduced from literature and extended with an auxiliary input.
Three controllers were implemented: a baseline thermostat control, linear model-predictive controller of a simplified tank model, and nonlinear model-predictive controller.
Simplified weather and behaviour models were used to evaluate the three control strategies under a range of conditions.
