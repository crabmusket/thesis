# Thesis

Model predictive control for solar hot water systems.

## Setup

Download [Vagrant][] and [VirtualBox][], then run `vagrant up` in this directory.
It will take some time.

[Vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com
[VirtualBox]: https://www.virtualbox.org/

## Software

I make use of [cvxpy][] and [python-control][] for the core of the work.
These two libraries in turn rely upon [Slycot][] and [SciPy][].
And, of course, [matplotlib][] creates beautiful plots.
